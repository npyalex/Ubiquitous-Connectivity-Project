# Ubiquitous Connectivity Project

###### Tracking the radios & sensor values
    Created an initial sketch that draws an ellipse for each radio 
    and changes the ellipse's size depending on the corresponding 
    potentiometer value - @maria
    
###### Generating colored squares
    Modified the code to generate squares that fill the screen and
    are centered in the middle of the sketch, sized in a gradated 
    manner - @maria

###### Incorporated Tyson's color code & consolidated all code
    Final update from Monday's testing session. Cleaned up code,
    removed map function in processing to work with Nick's calibration
    code in Arduino.
